# imbraw2dng
Convert RAW from I'm Back into DNG. They are not really "B&W RAW" but actually the RAW sensor data that also contains the colour filtering.

Currently known to work half-way for 35mm I'm Back and current MF Firmware.

MF Formats are know to make problems with older firmware.

**Installation:**

Copy the html file to your PC and open in your favorite browser (any newer one should do).

There is an online version at [imback.eu](https://imback.eu/home/im-back-raw-dng-converter-ib35/) but the image data will stay in your browser!

Problems should be discussed in the [I'm Back Users Group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1212628099691211).
