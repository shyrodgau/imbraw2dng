# imbraw2dng
Convert RAW from I'm Back into DNG. They are not really "B&W RAW" but actually the RAW sensor data that also contains the colour filtering.

Currently known to work for current firmware on 35mm (also for "Angle medium" and "small") and MF I'm Back.

**Installation:**

Copy the html file to your PC and open in your favorite browser (any newer one should do).

There is an online version at [imback.eu](https://imback.eu/home/im-back-raw-dng-converter-ib35/) but the image data will stay in your browser!

Problems should be discussed in the [I'm Back Users Group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1212628099691211).

**Processing the DNG:**

Use your favourite software, e.g. darktable, lightroom, ufraw, rawtherapee etc.

If the picture has a strong green or magenta tint all over, that usually can be levelled out by manual white-balancing. It is not the converter's fault but how the raw I'm Back samples are.

If a red highlighted spot is in the center of the image, a manual retouche after the processing is required.
