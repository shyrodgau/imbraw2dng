# imbapp - next generation access to ImB

oder [auf Deutsch](https://shyrodgau.github.io/imbraw2dng/imbapp_de)   
 [日本語](https://shyrodgau.github.io/imbraw2dng/imbapp_ja)
 
## Short Intro

Advantages over the [APP from ImB](https://imback.eu/home/app/):
- you can use it on any browser
- can display raw
- converts raw to DNG on download
- can be used offline just like imbraw2dng

Disadvantages over the APP from ImB:
- live image view not built in
- no local album browsing on PC/phone
- no tough guy looking at you

Advantages over the (my) [classic imbraw2dng](https://shyrodgau.github.io/imbraw2dng/imbraw2dng.html) when used on the ImB:
- can set the time of the ImB
- faster jpeg previews
- can set image parameters (size, EV...)

Disadvantages over the classic imbraw2dng when not used on the ImB:
- step-by-step is gone, either process all (file select button) or use app-like the picture browser (on drag and drop)

## Try it out

Download the file [imbapp.htm](https://github.com/shyrodgau/imbraw2dng/raw/master/imbapp.htm) to your computer or smartphone.

### Using a Micro SD reader/adapter

Take the Micro SD from your back and insert it into Micro SD Adapter on your computer or phone.

Open the contents of the Micro SD, it might be named `VOLUME1` or `0000-0001`and you should see a folder named `imback` or `IMBACK`.

Use your operating system/file explorer to copy the file `imbapp.htm` that you downloaded into the `imback` or `IMBACK` folder.  
<!--You can rename it with a language code `XX` (DE, JA, FR, more translations needed!) to `imbapp_XX.html` (note: `html` instead of `htm`!), but then you need to adjust the link below.-->

Eject the Micro SD from computer or phone and put back into your device - ready!

### Without removing the Micro SD from ImB

Put your Phone or PC into the ImB Wifi.

Use a new browser window or tab, navigate to [http://192.168.1.254/IMBACK/](http://192.168.1.254/IMBACK/).

Click on `Choose file` and select the `imbapp.htm` you just downloaded. Click `upload file` (wordings need to be checked) - ready!

## Ready to use!

Connect your computer or smartphone to the WIFI of the ImB.  
Navigate your browser to [http://192.168.1.254/IMBACK/IMBAPP.HTM](http://192.168.1.254/IMBACK/IMBAPP.HTM).

### Limitations

It has not been tested very good, please keep an eye on it and tell me if something does not work as you expect.

## Install the APP

This may not be possible at the moment because the standard requires https connection which ImB can not provide.

But most browser should allow to either add a bookmark for it or, on mobile, add a desktop shortcut that you can use like an app.

## Use locally

It can also be used locally or from [https://shyrodgau.github.io/imbraw2dng/imbapp.htm](https://shyrodgau.github.io/imbraw2dng/imbapp.htm) similar to the normal imbraw2dng.
