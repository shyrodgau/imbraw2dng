# imbapp - trying to replace the mobile app

oder [auf Deutsch](https://shyrodgau.github.io/imbraw2dng/imbapp_de)

## Short Intro

Improvements to the mobile app: use it also on PC/Mac, display RAW, convert RAW to DNG on download

## Try it out

Download the file [imbapp.htm](https://github.com/shyrodgau/imbraw2dng/raw/master/imbapp.htm) to your computer.

Take the Micro SD from your back and insert it into Micro SD Adapter on your computer. If you do not have one, I describe an alternative way, please ask for it.

Open the contents of the Micro SD, it might be named `VOLUME1` and you should see a folder named `imback` or `IMBACK`. Open that folder.
(You should see folders named `photo` and/or `movie`.)

Use your operating system/file explorer to copy the file `imbapp.htm` that you downloaded into that current imback folder.

Eject the Micro SD from computer and put back into your device.

## Ready to use!

Connect your computer or smartphone to the WIFI of the ImB.  
Navigate your browser to [http://192.168.1.254/IMBACK/IMBAPP.HTM](http://192.168.1.254/IMBACK/IMBAPP.HTM).

### Limitations

It has not been tested very good, please keep an eye on it and tell me if something does not work as you expect.

After taking a photo or movie, you can only preview it but not download it, you need to reload the app/page.

## Install the APP

This may not be possible because the standard requires https connection which ImB can not provide.

But most browser should allow to either add a bookmark for it or, on mobile, add a desktop shortcut that you can use like an app.
