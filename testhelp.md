# Test Help needed

I am preparing different versions of the 
- html version: named `imbapp.htm`
- and node.js version: named `imbraw2dngnn.js`
that use a different protocol communication with the ImBack device.

I would be interested if they differ from the classic versions.

Especially the **HTML page** and **Medium Format** or **older Firmware**.  
But that works only if you copy it onto your ImB:
1. download [imbapp.html](https://github.com/shyrodgau/imbraw2dng/raw/master/imbapp.html) to your PC or smartphone
1. connect PC or smartphone to the ImB WIFI
1. open [the device in browser](http://192.168.1.254/IMBACK) (in new browser tab)
1. click `Choose File`
1. select the `imbapp.htm` that you just downloaded
1. click `Upload Files`

For testing, navigate to the [new version on your ImB](http://192.168.1.254/IMBACK/IMBAPP.HTM) - it may take a while

Does it work as expected?

Do you note any difference?
